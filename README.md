# 3DPrintReport
Create word document from excel spreadsheet for reporting purposes

This was a fun mini project combining two of my skills and interests: Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Coding. The goal of the project was to generate a report in Microsoft Word from Python code. The application was an AM Status Report. This could be similar to a service bureau report containing three main sections of information: "Parts", "Printers", and "Materials". From initial research on the Python libraries needed, to the current state of the report, it took about 3 hours.
